## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal we have analysed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

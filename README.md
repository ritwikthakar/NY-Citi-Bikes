# NY-Citi-Bikes

## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal we have analysed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Link to the Analysis is given below

## Results 

### Checkout Times for Users

By looking at the checkout times by user chart, we see at majority of the users use the bicycles for less than one hour. Data shows that between the 15 to 20 minute mark, number of uses who ride bicycles start declining.
